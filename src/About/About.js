            I am a mexican digital artist who enjoys creating illustrations in
            which I can express my ideas and creativity. What I like to do the
            most is character design, either as fanart or my own.

            I actually studied mechatronics, and I have developed my passion for
            art since I was very young as a hobby. In the future I would like to
            be able to create projects in which I can combine both areas, since
            I believe that there is great potential in being able to make
            artistic ideas come true through technology and engineering
            principles.
